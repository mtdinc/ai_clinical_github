The pain is somewhat similar to an episode of herpes zoster (shingles) she had 15 years ago on her lower left back. The discomfort has caused difficulty sleeping at night. There is no radiation of the pain. Use of a heating pad provided no relief. Deep breathing and physical activity do not exacerbate the pain.

**Stage 2: Addition of Basic Laboratory Results and Imaging**

**Laboratory Data:**

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
  - White Blood Cells (WBC): 3.2 x 10⁹/L (Low)
  - Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL (Normal)
  - Platelets: 202 x 10⁹/L (Normal)

- **Basic Metabolic Panel:**
  - Sodium: 141 mmol/L (Normal)
  - Potassium: 4.4 mmol/L (Normal)
  - Chloride: 101 mmol/L (Normal)
  - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 19 mg/dL (Normal)
  - Creatinine: 0.72 mg/dL (Normal)

- **Liver Function Tests:**
  - Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): 36 U/L (Normal)
  - Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): 26 U/L (Normal)
  - Alkaline Phosphatase: 117 U/L (Normal)
  - Albumin: 4.4 g/dL (Normal)
  - Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH): 308 U/L (Elevated)
  - Creatine Kinase (CK): 133 U/L (Normal)
  - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 0.05 mg/dL (Normal)

**Imaging Studies:**

- **Chest X-Ray (CXR):**
  - Normal findings; no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities.

**Assessment and Plan at This Stage:**

- Differential diagnoses considered included a possible prodromal phase of herpes zoster due to the nature and location of the pain and her prior history.
- Initiated treatment with acyclovir for suspected herpes zoster.
- Prescribed pregabalin for neuropathic pain management.
- Advised to monitor symptoms and consider additional imaging (e.g., CT scan of the chest) if symptoms persisted or worsened.
