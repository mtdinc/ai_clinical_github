The patient reports an insidious onset of shortness of breath that has gradually progressed, rendering him unable to perform minimal activities such as dressing.

He experienced blackish discoloration of stools 2-3 times per day for three days, describing the stools as sticky and malodorous. He also had episodes of bleeding gums lasting for two days, which subsided without intervention.
