**Stage 1: Initial Patient Presentation**

A 59-year-old female presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath for the past three days. One week prior, she experienced abdominal discomfort and visited a local clinic where an endoscopy was performed. She was diagnosed with gastritis and started on esomeprazole. Three days ago, she developed shortness of breath and noticed mild swelling in her lower extremities. She returned to the local clinic and was told she had cystitis; medication was prescribed but her symptoms did not improve.

She reports associated symptoms of nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and poor appetite. She denies headache, chest pain, orthopnea, fever, diarrhea, bloody stools, or melena.

Her past medical history is significant for a transcervical uterine myomectomy 15 years ago and a spontaneous abortion. Obstetric history: gravida 3, para 2, abortus 1; she has one daughter and one son. Family history includes diabetes mellitus in her mother and colon cancer in her father.

Vital signs on admission are as follows:

- **Temperature**: 36.8°C
- **Heart Rate**: 105 beats per minute
- **Blood Pressure**: 104/76 mmHg
- **Respiratory Rate**: 13 breaths per minute
- **Oxygen Saturation**: 99% on room air

Physical examination reveals an alert and oriented woman in no acute distress. Head and neck examination shows no pallor or jaundice and no jugular venous distention. Cardiovascular examination reveals a regular heartbeat without murmurs. Pulmonary examination is unremarkable with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination reveals a soft and flat abdomen with diffuse tenderness on palpation. Neurological examination is normal. Mild lower extremity edema is noted.

- **Platelet Count**: 27×10^9/L (normal range: 150–450×10^9/L)
- **D-Dimer**: >10,000ng/mL (elevated)
- **International Normalized Ratio (INR)**: 1.3 (slightly elevated)
- **Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT)**: 26.8 seconds (normal range: 25–35 seconds)

- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: 46.5mg/L (elevated; normal <5mg/L)
- **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)**: 1,020U/L (elevated; normal range: 140–280U/L)
- **Haptoglobin**: <7mg/dL (decreased; normal range: 30–200mg/dL)
- **Lactate**: 10.1mg/dL (elevated; normal range: 4.5–19.8mg/dL)

Imaging studies:

- **Chest X-ray**: Normal findings.
- **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Rare fragmented red blood cells observed; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) considered unlikely.
- **Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) Scan**:
  - Evidence of diverticulitis.
  - Massive thrombus detected in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium (RA).
- **Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA)**:
  - Persistent filling defects in the RA, right ventricle (RV), IVC, and iliac veins.
  - Thrombus shows progression in size and distribution.
  - Mesenteric stranding in the upper abdomen.
  - Mild ascites present.
  - Swollen bowel loops suspected due to congestion.
  - Heterogeneous liver parenchyma and periportal edema suggesting congestion.
  - Wall thickening and edema of the gallbladder, also suspected due to congestion.
- **Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)**:
  - Ejection Fraction (EF): 75%
  - Mild tricuspid regurgitation.
  - Mild mitral regurgitation.
  - Mild aortic regurgitation.
  - Floating thrombus visualized in the IVC, RA, and RV.
