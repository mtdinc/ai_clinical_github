### **Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 38-year-old male presents with a one-month history of easy fatigability and generalized weakness. He notes that he has appeared pale during this time. A few days prior to presentation, he underwent a complete blood count (CBC) which revealed low hemoglobin levels. A chest X-ray performed at that time showed a widened mediastinum without evidence of consolidation.
