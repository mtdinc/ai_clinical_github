**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

**Chief Complaint:**
A 38-year-old female presents with seizures, altered mental status, and weakness in the lower extremities.

**History of Present Illness:**
Two weeks prior, the patient was on a family trip to Hawaii where she experienced a sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was admitted to a local hospital for three days and then discharged. She described the abdominal pain as "like thousands of hot inflamed knives stabbing my stomach" and attributed it to seafood consumed on the first day of the trip. Since that episode, her oral intake has been minimal. Two weeks later, she experienced seizures and reported one day of weakness in her lower limbs. She has unintentionally lost 10 pounds over the past month due to decreased appetite.
