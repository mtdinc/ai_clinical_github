**Case Presentation:**

A 22-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of severe body aches that began three weeks ago. The pain started in her back and progressively extended to her chest and pelvic girdle. She rates the pain as 8 out of 10 in severity. Movement exacerbates the pain, interfering with her breathing and daily activities to the point where she is unable to stand or walk due to the intensity. Over-the-counter NSAIDs provide mild relief, while tramadol offers moderate relief.

She reports feeling tired and notes the presence of respiratory symptoms but denies fever, chills, recent travel, tingling, numbness, or weakness. She has no sick contacts and denies symptoms of sore throat or cough.
