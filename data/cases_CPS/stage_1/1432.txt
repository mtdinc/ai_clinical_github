### **Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

**Chief Complaint:**
A 59-year-old female presents with new-onset altered mental status on day 24 of hospitalization.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient was admitted 24 days ago for severe diarrhea attributed to *Clostridioides difficile* infection. She required intensive care unit (ICU) admission and was managed with intravenous fluids and catecholamines for hemodynamic support. During her hospitalization, she developed polyarthritis affecting her elbows, shoulders, and wrists bilaterally. Laboratory studies revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), but she was seronegative for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies. She was started on high-dose prednisone at 60mg daily, which was tapered down to 40mg over the past week due to inadequate response. Given the lack of improvement, Tocilizumab was initiated.

She required intubation for airway protection during her ICU stay and was managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). She has since been extubated and transferred out of the ICU.

Over the past day, nursing staff noted that the patient appeared increasingly confused and was slow to respond to questions.
