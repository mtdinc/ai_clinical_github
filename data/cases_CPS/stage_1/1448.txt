**Stage 1: Initial Patient Presentation**

---

**Chief Complaint:**
"Heartburn" worsening over the past two weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**
A 75-year-old male with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presents to the emergency department due to episodes of heartburn persisting for the past two weeks. These episodes are provoked by any physical activity and have been increasing in frequency and intensity. The heartburn is described as "excruciating and debilitating," lasting between 10 to 30 minutes, and is located in the mid-chest with radiation down both arms and to the substernal region. Resting, ceasing exertion, and drinking cold water provide relief. The patient notes that his usual antacids (Alka-Seltzer and omeprazole) have not alleviated his symptoms during this period. Before the onset of these symptoms, he was in his usual state of health, engaging in household activities and short walks without issues. He denies any correlation between the episodes and food intake, unlike his typical GERD symptoms, which are triggered by certain foods and relieved by antacids. Associated symptoms include nausea, sweating, and a generalized feeling of weakness. He denies any worsening of symptoms when lying down or leaning forward, lower extremity swelling, fevers, shortness of breath, vomiting, fainting, dizziness, syncope, or changes in weight.
