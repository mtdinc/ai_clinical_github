- **Progression:** Initial weakness in the upper limbs progressed to the lower limbs.
- **Dysphagia:** More pronounced with both liquids and solids.
- **Shortness of Breath:** Developed one day ago.
- **Other Symptoms:** No reports of fever, headache, vision changes, or sensory disturbances.

**Past Medical History:**

**Allergies:**

- No known drug or food allergies.

**Vital Signs:**

- Temperature: 99°F (37.2°C)
- Heart Rate: 126 beats per minute
- Blood Pressure: 90/70 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 22 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 96% on room air

**Physical Examination:**

- **General Appearance:** Anxious but alert and oriented to time, place, and person.
- **Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT):** Medial deviation of the right eye (right-sided abducens nerve palsy).
- **Cardiovascular:** Tachycardia noted; normal jugular venous pressure; heart sounds normal without murmurs.
- **Pulmonary:** Clear breath sounds bilaterally; no wheezes or crackles.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present.
- **Neurological Examination:**
  - **Cranial Nerves:**
    - Right-sided abducens nerve palsy (cranial nerve VI).
    - Bilateral facial nerve weakness (cranial nerve VII).
    - Absent gag reflex (cranial nerves IX and X).
    - Decreased tongue movements (cranial nerve XII).
  - **Motor Strength (Medical Research Council Scale):**
    - Right Upper Extremity: 3/5
    - Left Upper Extremity: 7/8
    - Right Lower Extremity: 3/8
    - Left Lower Extremity: 3/8
  - **Reflexes:** Generalized hyporeflexia; reduced plantar reflexes bilaterally.
  - **Sensory Examination:** Intact to light touch, pinprick, and vibration throughout.
- **Skin:** No rashes or lesions observed.

**Events During Examination:**

- The patient experienced a sudden collapse associated with hemodynamic instability:
  - Blood Pressure dropped to 70/50 mmHg.
  - Oxygen saturation decreased to 88% despite low-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy.
- Emergency measures:
  - Rapid sequence intubation performed for airway protection and respiratory support.
  - Cardiology consulted.
  - Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia.
