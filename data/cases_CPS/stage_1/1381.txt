**Stage 1 Case Presentation:**

A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding that began two months ago. She describes her stools as black, hard, and tarry, consistent with melena. She reports no associated pain with the bleeding. She was hospitalized previously for similar symptoms, during which she received two units of blood, was admitted for medical management, and had a Gastroenterology consult.

In her review of systems, she notes fatigue over the past two months. She denies hematemesis, petechiae, mucosal bleeding, fever, or chills.

Her past medical history is significant for cirrhosis, a prior gastric ulcer that resulted in bleeding, bipolar disorder, depression, and asthma. She has no history of surgeries.

Currently, she is receiving the following medications during her hospital stay: continuous plasmalite as needed, pantoprazole (Protonix), and hydroxyzine for anxiety.

Family history includes alcohol abuse in her maternal uncle.

Social history reveals that she is currently incarcerated and has not had consistent access to medical care. She has a history of alcohol abuse starting in 2014, with documented withdrawal symptoms in 2022. She does not smoke, use illicit drugs, have pets, or report recent travel.

She has allergies to shellfish, which causes urticaria, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which lead to rash and thrombocytopenia.
