**Stage 1**

**Chief Complaint:**
A 76-year-old man presents with a three-month history of dyspnea.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports a persistent cough producing brown sputum, which he suspects may contain blood (hemoptysis). He experiences shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. There are no associated fevers or chills. He denies any chest pain or recent travel.

Two months earlier, he was admitted to an outside hospital for pneumonia. A computed tomography (CT) scan at that time revealed infiltrates in the left lower lobe (LLL) and right lower lobe (RLL). He was treated with ampicillin/sulbactam during hospitalization and discharged on amoxicillin/clavulanate and a course of steroids.

Three weeks prior to the current presentation, he was readmitted due to generalized weakness and a fall. During that admission, he also experienced hemoptysis. A repeat CT scan showed worsening RLL infiltrates and resolution of the LLL infiltrate. Sputum cultures grew extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing **Escherichia coli** sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam. He was discharged on this antibiotic for a total duration of two weeks along with a steroid taper. At a skilled nursing facility, he was restarted on piperacillin/tazobactam for unknown reasons.
