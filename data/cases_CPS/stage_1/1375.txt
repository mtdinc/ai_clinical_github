**Case Presentation - Stage 1**

A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a three-day history of burning sensation during urination. She reports dysuria accompanied by generalized malaise, nausea, and reduced oral intake. She was brought to the hospital by her daughter. She denies fever, chills, vomiting, hematuria, vaginal discharge or dryness, cough, shortness of breath, or recent falls.

Her medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus (most recent HbA1c of 6.6%), hypertension, dementia, and previous urinary tract infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. One month ago, she was diagnosed with marginal zone lymphoma, which initially presented with weight loss, fatigue, and soft tissue lesions; a lymph node biopsy was performed. She has not started treatment yet due to concerns about disease progression and underwent a repeat biopsy the morning prior to this presentation.

Her medications include lisinopril, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and metformin. She has no known drug allergies.

Socially, she lives alone at her home in Colorado. She has five children who are currently staying with her. She has not traveled recently. She does not use tobacco or consume alcohol.
