**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 37-year-old female with a history of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) presents to the emergency department with complaints of malaise, chest discomfort, and a spreading rash on her left leg. Four days prior, she attended a hematology clinic visit for management of her ITP. Her baseline platelet count is typically around 125,000/mm³ but was noted to be 60,000/mm³ at that visit. She is adherent to her medication, eltrombopag, and received a rituximab infusion during that clinic visit.

Two days ago, she began experiencing general malaise and chest pain, which has progressively worsened. She also noticed a rash developing on her left leg that has been spreading. She reports shortness of breath but denies fever or other systemic symptoms.

Her past medical history is significant for ITP and a rheumatologic evaluation two years ago for symptoms of fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, and ITP; antibody testing was conducted at that time. She has no known allergies. She denies any significant family or social history.
