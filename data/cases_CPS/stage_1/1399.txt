**Chief Complaint:**
A 64-year-old male presents with bilateral wrist swelling.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports progressive swelling of his left wrist that began two weeks ago. Around that time, he increased his intake of seafood. His primary care physician prescribed ibuprofen and colchicine, which led to some improvement. He then experienced vertigo and dizziness and visited the emergency department, where he was diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) and prescribed prednisolone, with subsequent improvement in symptoms. However, he later developed bilateral wrist swelling, which has affected his ability to perform regular manual work and is accompanied by morning stiffness. He denies any trauma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), insect bites, or recent sexual activity. He also denies fever, abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, or visual acuity changes.
