**Stage 1**

**Case Presentation:**

A 43-year-old male from Connecticut presents with recurrent episodes of hives, vomiting, cramping, and epigastric pain accompanied by watery, non-bloody stools. These symptoms have been occurring over the past year. The patient cannot identify any specific triggers but suspects they may be related to his diet. He notes that Gravol (dimenhydrinate) sometimes provides slight improvement. The episodes are intermittent, with symptom-free periods lasting several weeks during which he feels normal. He denies any voice changes, throat swelling, bloating, greasy or floating stools, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, melena, hematochezia, or recent antibiotic use. Hot showers and proton pump inhibitors do not alleviate his symptoms.
