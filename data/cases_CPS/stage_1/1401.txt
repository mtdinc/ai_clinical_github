A 54-year-old male presents to the clinic with weakness and dizziness lasting for 4 days.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports persistent weakness and dizziness that began 4 days ago. One week prior to these symptoms, he experienced an episode of moderate chest pain.

Concerned about these persistent symptoms, he decided to visit the clinic.
