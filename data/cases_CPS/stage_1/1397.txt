**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 81-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status and drowsiness. Five days prior, he developed a mild headache and a fever of 105°F (40.5°C), which he attributed to a common cold or flu. The symptoms progressed, with fever spiking at 103°F (39.4°C), alongside muscle weakness, nausea, and generalized weakness. Two days before admission, his wife noted increasing forgetfulness and confusion. He struggled with word-finding, had difficulty following simple instructions, appeared drowsy throughout the day, and required assistance to walk due to leg weakness. Concerned by his decline, his wife brought him to the hospital.
