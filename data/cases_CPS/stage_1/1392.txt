**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

**Chief Complaint:**
"I can't see out of my right eye."

**History of Present Illness:**
A 67-year-old right-handed male cattle rancher presented with a sudden onset of vision loss in his right eye while watching television with his wife. He reported that he slowly felt like he was in a "daze" and noticed he couldn't see over his right side. The sensation of being in a daze resolved, and he experienced no difficulties with walking, but his right-sided vision impairment persisted. He describes a mild headache localized mostly in the temples.

Three months prior, he experienced intermittent tingling in his right arm, similar to the sensation of it "falling asleep." The tingling was worse in the hand, occasionally radiated to the upper arm, and was sometimes painful. He has had trouble gripping small objects but reports normal overall strength. The symptoms did not preferentially affect one side of the hand over the other.
