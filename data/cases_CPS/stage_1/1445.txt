**Stage 1: Initial Patient Presentation**

---

**Chief Complaint:**
A 66-year-old male presents with shortness of breath (SOB) with exertion.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports developing progressive shortness of breath with exertion over the past month. He notes increasing fatigue and worsening chest tightness during this period. He was referred for an outpatient stress transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) but was unable to complete the test due to severe dyspnea and shakiness. An electrocardiogram (EKG) performed at that time showed ST depressions, and the echocardiogram revealed wall motion abnormalities. Based on these findings, he was directed to the emergency department for further evaluation.

A review of systems is notable for palpitations, a persistent cough, an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds, and recurrent canker sores over the past few years. He denies fevers, chills, or any episodes of bleeding.
