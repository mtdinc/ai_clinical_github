**Stage 1 Case Presentation:**

A 42-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a two-week history of progressive fatigue and jaundice. Fourteen days ago, he developed significant fatigue to the point of being unable to stand, without associated fever. He was evaluated at an external hospital where anemia was detected, and he received three units of blood transfusions. Two days following the transfusions, he noticed progressive yellowing of his skin and eyes, petechiae on his lower limbs, and joint pain in his left knee accompanied by swelling and redness. He denies nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, bleeding, or other complaints.

His past medical history is significant for chronic kidney disease secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy, blindness due to retinal detachment, hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, and obesity.

His medications include levothyroxine, hydralazine, carvedilol, amlodipine, folic acid, calcium carbonate, aspirin, furosemide, NPH insulin, erythropoietin, and simvastatin.

He does not smoke, consume alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no recent travel history. His mother has a history of drug-induced cholangitis. He has no known allergies.
