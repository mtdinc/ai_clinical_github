**Stage 1 Case Presentation:**

A 72-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy, chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes, and hypertension presents with retrosternal chest pain. The pain radiates to her back and left arm, began this morning, and has been intermittent throughout the day. It is exacerbated by movement, preventing her from performing daily activities. She reports experiencing similar pain with activity 3-4 times per month, but never this intense. Two nights prior, her son passed away.

She also notes dysuria for the past week without associated urgency or frequency. She sleeps with three pillows at home but denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.

Medications include insulin and aspirin; she is unsure about her other medications. She smokes hookah but denies cigarette use, alcohol, or other substances. She lives alone, has three involved sons, and bakes bread in traditional furnaces.

**Vital Signs (Day 1):**

- Temperature: Afebrile
- Heart Rate: 80 beats per minute
- Blood Pressure: 160/110 mmHg (bilaterally)
- Respiratory Rate: 15 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 94% on room air

**Physical Examination:**

- **General:** Ill-appearing female.
- **Cardiovascular:** S₃ heart sound present; no murmurs. Pulses are intact and symmetric.
- **Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- **Abdomen:** Unremarkable; no thrills or bruits.
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.
- **Extremities/Skin:** Bilateral lower extremity edema, left greater than right.

**Stage 2 Case Presentation:**

**Laboratory Findings:**

- **Complete Blood Count:**
  - White Blood Cell count: 3.47 x 10⁹/L (85% neutrophils)
  - Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL (Mean Corpuscular Volume: 88 fL)
  - Platelets: 114 x 10⁹/L
- **Basic Metabolic Panel:**
  - Sodium: 133 mEq/L
  - Potassium: 4.4 mEq/L
  - Blood Urea Nitrogen: 105 mg/dL (Normal: 17-43 mg/dL)
  - Creatinine: 1.65 mg/dL (Baseline unknown)
  - Glucose: 180 mg/dL
- **Urinalysis:** Trace protein and glucose detected.

**Imaging Studies:**

- **Electrocardiogram (Day 1):** Normal sinus rhythm without ST segment changes.
- **Chest X-Ray:** Elevated right hemidiaphragm.

**Clinical Course (Day 2):**

On the second day of admission, the patient develops a cough and dyspnea. She becomes febrile, and her oxygen saturation drops to 70% on room air, improving to 97% with 4 liters of supplemental oxygen. Repeat electrocardiogram reveals atrial flutter without ST segment changes.
