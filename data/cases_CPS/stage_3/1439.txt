**Case Presentation:**

A 55-year-old African American female presents to the outpatient clinic with a diffuse, pruritic rash that began 24 hours ago. The rash appeared 48 hours after receiving her third dose (first booster) of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). She has a known allergy to penicillin but had no adverse reactions to previous vaccinations, including the first two doses of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

Initially treated with topical mometasone cream, oral prednisone, and hydroxyzine, the patient's rash worsened over the next 48 hours (day 5 since rash onset). The rash became larger with persistent itching, burning sensations, and bilateral ankle pain.

At 10 days since rash onset, due to progression of symptoms, she was started on intravenous steroids and antihistamines.
