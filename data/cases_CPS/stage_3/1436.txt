**Imaging Studies:**

- **Chest X-Ray (CXR):**
  - Small effusion in the left basal aspect of the lung.
  - Hazy opacities observed in the left lower lung field.

- **Computed Tomography (CT) Scan of the Chest:**
  - Small left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary embolism without evidence of right heart strain.
  - Left lower lobe consolidation with air bronchograms.
  - Small pleural effusion; unsuccessful attempt at thoracentesis.

**Hospital Course (Days 1-3):**

- **Day 1-2:**
  - The patient becomes progressively hypoxemic, requiring high-flow nasal cannula at 60 L/min with 90% FiO₂ to maintain oxygen saturation of 92%.
  - Point-of-care ultrasound shows unchanged pleural effusion size.
  - Initiated on intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin for suspected pneumonia.

- **Day 3:**
  - Transferred to the Intensive Care Unit due to worsening respiratory status.
  - Started on hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours for suspected underlying inflammation.
  - Receives hydromorphone, ketorolac, and morphine for pain management.
  - Despite interventions, the patient's condition continues to deteriorate.
