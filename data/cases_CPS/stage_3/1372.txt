**Stage 2**

**Laboratory Data:**

- **Hematology:**

- **Chemistry:**
  - Sodium: 145mEq/L
  - Potassium: 4.9mEq/L
  - Chloride: 98mEq/L
  - Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST): 65U/L
  - Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT): 77U/L

**Imaging Studies:**

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG):**
  - Ventricular tachycardia noted
  - ST-segment elevations in inferior leads consistent with inferior STEMI
