**Stage 1: Initial Patient Presentation**

---

**Chief Complaint:**
"Heartburn" worsening over the past two weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**
A 75-year-old male with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presents to the emergency department due to episodes of heartburn persisting for the past two weeks. These episodes are provoked by any physical activity and have been increasing in frequency and intensity. The heartburn is described as "excruciating and debilitating," lasting between 10 to 30 minutes, and is located in the mid-chest with radiation down both arms and to the substernal region. Resting, ceasing exertion, and drinking cold water provide relief. The patient notes that his usual antacids (Alka-Seltzer and omeprazole) have not alleviated his symptoms during this period. Before the onset of these symptoms, he was in his usual state of health, engaging in household activities and short walks without issues. He denies any correlation between the episodes and food intake, unlike his typical GERD symptoms, which are triggered by certain foods and relieved by antacids. Associated symptoms include nausea, sweating, and a generalized feeling of weakness. He denies any worsening of symptoms when lying down or leaning forward, lower extremity swelling, fevers, shortness of breath, vomiting, fainting, dizziness, syncope, or changes in weight.

**Review of Systems:**

- **General:** Reports nausea, sweating, and generalized weakness.

- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm; systolic murmur heard best at the upper sternal border.
- **Pulmonary:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended.
- **Extremities:** Warm skin; mild bilateral ankle edema (+1).
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented; no focal deficits.

**Stage 2: Addition of Basic Diagnostic Information**

---

**Laboratory Studies:**

- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**
  - White Blood Cell Count: 21.8×10⁹/L (lymphocyte predominant, stable from previous measurements)
  - Hemoglobin: Within normal limits
  - Platelets: Within normal limits

- **Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP):**
  - Sodium: Within normal limits
  - Potassium: Within normal limits
  - Chloride: Within normal limits
  - Bicarbonate: Within normal limits
  - Blood Urea Nitrogen: Within normal limits
  - Creatinine: 1.01 mg/dL (baseline)

- **Cardiac Markers:**
  - Troponin I:
    - Initial: 183 ng/L
    - 2 hours later: 256 ng/L
    - Subsequent levels: 520 ng/L, 655 ng/L, 666 ng/L (rising trend)
  - B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP): 866 pg/mL (elevated)

**Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

- Initial ECG:
  - Sinus tachycardia at a rate of 102 bpm
  - Right bundle branch block (RBBB)
  - Left anterior fascicular block (LAFB)
  - Non-specific T wave changes
  - Compared to baseline ECG from four months prior: Previously noted <1 mm ST depression in leads V3-V4

- Repeat ECG (2 hours later):
  - New ST depression in leads V2-V6
- Overnight ECG:
  - Resolution of T wave changes

**Chest X-Ray (CXR):**

- No pleural effusions
- Cardiac silhouette within normal limits

**Interventions:**

- Administered aspirin
- Initiated heparin therapy
- Started high-intensity statin

**Echocardiogram:**

- Current Echocardiogram:
  - Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF): 30% (reduced)
  - Global hypokinesis of the left ventricle
  - No regional wall motion abnormalities
  - Moderate aortic stenosis

- Comparison with Echocardiogram from 1.5 Years Ago:
  - LVEF: 65% (normal)
  - Mild aortic stenosis at that time

**Additional Information:**

- **Physical Examination Updates:**
  - No new physical findings
- **Laboratory Studies:**
  - No significant changes in laboratory values beyond those previously noted
- **Imaging:**
  - No additional imaging studies provided
