**Stage 1 Case Presentation:**

A 47-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with progressive dizziness and shortness of breath over the past three weeks. She reports pain in her ankles and hands without swelling or redness. Over the past six months, she has experienced a 20-pound weight gain, cessation of menstruation (amenorrhea), hair loss, and constipation. She denies fever, chills, chest pain, headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, rashes, or leg swelling but notes chronic pain in both knees.

Her medical history is significant for atrophic gastritis, iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and bilateral knee osteoarthritis. She is not currently taking iron or vitamin B12 supplements. Her medications include acetaminophen as needed and "ArtiKing," which contains diclofenac and dexamethasone.

She smokes approximately one pack of cigarettes every two weeks and consumes alcohol socially. She works as a cook, is originally from El Salvador, and has lived in Texas all her life. She has no children and was adopted as a child, so her family history is unknown. No known allergies are reported.

**Vital Signs:**

- Temperature: Afebrile
- Heart Rate: 63 beats per minute
- Blood Pressure: 111/62 mmHg
- Respiratory Rate: 18 breaths per minute
- Oxygen Saturation: 97% on room air
- Body Mass Index (BMI): 42 kg/m²

**Physical Examination:**

- **General:** Awake, alert, with a full, rounded face.
- **HEENT:** Conjunctival pallor noted. No lymphadenopathy. An enlarged dorsal fat pad is observed.
- **Cardiovascular:** Normal heart sounds; no murmurs.
- **Respiratory:** Clear breath sounds bilaterally.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, no rebound tenderness.
- **Neurological:** No visual field abnormalities. Cranial nerves II–XII are intact.
- **Extremities/Skin:** No erythema, warmth, or synovitis in the joints. Stretch marks with faint reddish-purple discoloration are present on the bilateral abdomen. Peripheral pulses are 2+ bilaterally.
