**Stage 3: Comprehensive Diagnostic Data**

**Additional Laboratory Results:**

- **Inflammatory Markers:**
  - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 56.6 mg/L (elevated)

- **Cardiac Enzymes:**
  - Troponin I: Initial value 1,809 ng/L (elevated), increased to over 4,000 ng/L upon subsequent testing.

  - Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): 51% (normal).
  - Presence of pericardial effusion without signs of cardiac tamponade.
  - No valvular abnormalities detected.
