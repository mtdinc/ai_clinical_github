A 59-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and hypertension was found unresponsive at home by family members. Upon awakening, he appeared confused and disoriented. Bilateral wrist lacerations were noted, and empty bottles of diphenhydramine, nifedipine, and carvedilol were found nearby. According to his family, he has been sleeping only one hour per night for the past two weeks. He has missed his peritoneal dialysis sessions at home during this period. There are no reports of delusions, hallucinations, or expressed suicidal ideation.
