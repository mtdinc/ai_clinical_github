**Stage 1**

**Chief Complaint:**
A 62-year-old male presents with a 1-week history of productive cough.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports a 1-week history of worsening productive cough and shortness of breath. He also notes the development of a lesion on his forehead that resembles a blister; it does not hurt or itch. One week prior to this presentation, he visited an urgent care facility for right ear pain, congestion, and cough, where his temperature was recorded at 100.9°F (38.3°C). He was prescribed azithromycin for five days and neomycin-polymyxin ear drops. He subsequently saw his primary care physician, who prescribed antibiotics for community-acquired pneumonia. Despite these treatments, his symptoms have continued to worsen, and he has become progressively more fatigued over the past week, prompting his visit to the emergency department. He also reports experiencing pleuritic chest pain. He denies nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
