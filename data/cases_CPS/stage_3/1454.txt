**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

- **Chief Complaint**: A 26-year-old female with a history of Class III obesity presents with 4-5 days of severe epigastric pain.

- **History of Present Illness**: The patient reports a pressing sensation in her abdomen that has been progressively worsening over the past several days. The pain intensifies with inspiration and is relieved by leaning forward. She endorses shortness of breath, cough, hoarseness, and nausea. She denies fevers, chills, lightheadedness, diarrhea, constipation, and has no known sick contacts.

- **Past Medical History**:

- **Medications**:
  - Famotidine 10 mg as needed for heartburn.

- **Family History**:
  - Mother deceased from triple-negative breast cancer.

- **Social History**:
  - Lives alone in an apartment.
  - Employed in protective child services.

- **Health-Related Behaviors**:
  - Denies tobacco use.
  - Denies alcohol consumption.
  - Denies illicit drug use.

  - Respiratory Rate: 16 breaths per minute
  - Oxygen Saturation: 95% on room air

- **Physical Examination**:
  - **General**: Alert, well-appearing female.
  - **Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT)**: Normocephalic, atraumatic; distended neck veins observed.
  - **Cardiovascular**: Regular rate and rhythm (RRR); normal S1 and S2 heart sounds.
  - **Pulmonary**: No increased work of breathing.

**Stage 2: Initial Diagnostics**

- **Laboratory Findings**:

  - **Hematology**:
    - White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 13.9 x 10⁹/L (Elevated)
    - Hemoglobin (Hgb): 11.8 g/dL (Low normal)
    - Hematocrit (Hct): 36%
    - Platelets (Plt): 82 x 10⁹/L (Low)

  - **Chemistry**:
    - Sodium (Na): 138 mmol/L
    - Potassium (K): 4.0 mmol/L
    - Chloride (Cl): 103 mmol/L
    - Bicarbonate (HCO₃): 18 mmol/L (Low)
    - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): [Not provided]
    - Creatinine (Cr): 0.79 mg/dL
    - Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP): 188 pg/mL (Elevated)
    - Lactic Acid: 16.72 mmol/L (Elevated)
    - Troponin: 17 ng/mL (Elevated)

- **Imaging Studies**:

  - **Electrocardiogram (EKG)**:
    - Right axis deviation.
    - Low voltage QRS complexes.

  - **Computed Tomography Angiography of the Chest (CT Angiogram)**:
    - No evidence of pulmonary embolism.
    - Incidental finding of a moderate to large pericardial effusion, mildly complex in attenuation.

**Stage 3: Comprehensive Diagnostics and Interventions**

- **Additional Imaging and Diagnostic Studies**:

  - **Echocardiogram**:
    - Normal systolic function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60-65%.
    - Significant pericardial effusion noted.
    - Increased ventricular wall thickness; concentric hypertrophy observed.
    - Large and mobile mass present in the right atrium (RA) traversing the tricuspid valve.
    - Mass extends into the right ventricle (RV).

  - **Pericardiocentesis**:
    - Performed with drainage of 1.2 liters of bloody pericardial fluid.

  - **Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** (obtained after pericardiocentesis):
    - Ejection fraction reduced to 30%.
    - Mass centered in the free wall of the RV, attached by a stalk.
    - Mass occupies approximately 50% of the RA cavity.

  - **Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan**:
    - Focal uptake identified in the cardiac mass.
    - Additional uptake observed in pulmonary nodules.

  - **Cytology**:
    - Analysis of pericardial fluid shows no malignant cells.
