**Case Presentation**

---

### **Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 58-year-old female presents with a two-week history of body swelling, primarily involving her legs up to the knees, along with trouble breathing and weight gain. She reports intermittent symptoms during this period. She adheres to a salt-restricted diet. This is her second hospitalization within a month due to leg swelling and fluid overload.

Her medical history is significant for uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a recent HbA1c of 12.1%, interstitial lung disease (primary pulmonary fibrosis) requiring 1-2 liters of oxygen via nasal cannula, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) characterized by grade 2 diastolic dysfunction (ejection fraction of 65%). She has a history of a right atrial myxoma that was surgically resected.

She is physically active. Medications include dapagliflozin, insulin glargine, insulin lispro, spironolactone 25mg, and apixaban.

**Vital Signs:**

### **Stage 3: Advanced Diagnostics**

**Cardiac Studies:**

- **Echocardiogram:**
  - Pulmonary artery pressures are normal.
  - Findings confirm heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

- **Cardiac MRI:**
  - Decreased left and right ventricular volumes.
  - Evidence of infiltrative cardiomyopathy.
  - Small pericardial effusion present.
  - Enhancement of the left ventricle observed.
  - Small bilateral pleural effusions noted.

**Additional Laboratory Tests:**

- **Serum Protein Electrophoresis:**
  - Presence of an M spike.
  - Elevated kappa to lambda light chain ratio.

- **Pyrophosphate Scan:**
  - Negative for cardiac amyloidosis.

- **Biopsy Findings:**
  - T-cell infiltrates observed.
  - Positive staining for CD3 and CD4 markers.
