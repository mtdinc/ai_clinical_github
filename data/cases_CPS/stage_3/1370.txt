**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

An 84-year-old male presents to the emergency department with right lower extremity pain that began this morning after a fall. He reports associated fever, chills, and generalized weakness. One week prior, he was treated for diverticulitis complicated by an abscess and received ceftriaxone and metronidazole. He denies any recent trauma besides the fall and mentions that the pain has progressively worsened.

  - White Blood Cell Count: 2.6 x10^9/L (neutrophil predominant)
  - Hemoglobin: 9.4 g/dL
  - Platelets: 45 x10^9/L
- **Basic Metabolic Panel:**
  - Creatinine: 1.53 mg/dL
- **Inflammatory Markers:**
  - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): 15.3 mg/dL
  - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): 25 mm/hr
- **Iron Studies:**
  - Iron: 18 µg/dL
  - Transferrin: 152 mg/dL
  - Total Iron-Binding Capacity (TIBC): 152 µg/dL
  - Transferrin Saturation: 12%
  - Ferritin: 861 ng/mL

  - Respiratory Viral Panel: Negative
  - Methicillin-Resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA): Negative

**Stage 3: Advanced Diagnostics**

**Hospital Course:**

At an outside hospital, the patient was initially treated with ceftriaxone for presumed cellulitis without improvement. A leg biopsy there showed no evidence of vasculitis. Upon admission to the current hospital, his skin lesion progressed to a necrotic area with blisters, necessitating surgical debridement. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) but showed no significant improvement.

**Additional Laboratory Results:**

- **Chronic Pancytopenia** noted over multiple admissions
- **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Persistently elevated at 265 U/L (normal <243 U/L)
- **Inflammatory Markers:** CRP remained elevated at 15.3 mg/dL

**Advanced Infectious Workup:**

- Wound cultures grew **Bactrim-resistant MRSA**

**Dermatology Biopsy Findings:**

- Inflammatory infiltration with rare neutrophils and variable plasma cells
- No evidence of vasculitis
- Negative for mycobacterial organisms on special staining
