**Stage 1: Initial Patient Presentation**

**Chief Complaint:**
An 80-year-old male presents with worsening renal function.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient reports a progressive, holocranial headache and shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. Over the past week, he has experienced hearing loss, mild abdominal pain, arthralgia, sleep disturbances, and a decline in mood secondary to pain. His hospital course was complicated by a hypertensive emergency requiring admission to the intensive care unit.

**Past Medical History:**

- Chronic kidney disease stage IIIA
- Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
- Atrial fibrillation
- Status post left atrial appendage closure
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia
- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (diagnosed last year)
- Recent hospitalization for myopericarditis secondary to left atrial appendage closure

**Family History:**

- Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance in unspecified family members

**Social History:**

- Consumes wine; quantity not specified
- Denies smoking
- Ambulates with a walker due to unsteady gait

**Medications:**

- Eliquis® (apixaban)
- Lipitor® (atorvastatin)
- Aldactone® (spironolactone)

**Allergies:**

- No known drug allergies reported

**Vital Signs:**

- Heart Rate: 125 beats per minute
- Blood Pressure: 190/100 mm Hg
- Respiratory Rate: Not provided
- Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air
- Temperature: Not provided

**Physical Examination:**

- **General:** Ill-appearing elderly male
- **Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, Throat (HEENT):** Pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation (PERRLA); otherwise normal examination
- **Cardiovascular:** Elevated jugular venous distention (>15 cm H₂O); soft systolic murmur heard on auscultation
- **Pulmonary:** Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally
- **Abdomen:** Mild abdominal discomfort; last bowel movement occurred five days ago
- **Extremities/Skin:** 3+ lower extremity edema; presence of skin lesions consistent with aging; unsteady gait requiring use of a walker

**Stage 3: Comprehensive Diagnostic Data**

**Advanced Laboratory Findings:**

- **Immunology:**
  - Kappa Free Light Chain: 67 mg/L
  - Kappa/Lambda Ratio: 2.2 (normal range <3.3 for CKD stage IIIB)
  - Repeat Kappa Free Light Chain: 145 mg/L
