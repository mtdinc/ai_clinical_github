Stage 1: Initial Presentation

A 32-year-old female web developer is brought to the ED by her roommate after a concerning video call with her team. Coworkers noted increasingly disorganized project presentations and erratic emails over the past week. The roommate reports finding multiple incomplete grocery delivery orders on their doorstep and hearing her pacing at night. She's lost interest in her usual cooking hobby, saying it's "too hot in the kitchen," and has been surviving on smoothies and energy drinks. During the video call today, she appeared confused about ongoing projects and had difficulty holding her phone steady.
