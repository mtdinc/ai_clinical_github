**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 52-year-old female presents to her primary care clinic with a five-day history of progressive weakness in her legs. She initially noticed that she was tripping more frequently and had difficulty climbing stairs at work, which she attributed to fatigue from increased work hours. Over the past two days, she has started to feel unsteady when walking and requires support when going up steps. She also mentions mild aching pain in her lower back and thighs, which she thought was due to poor posture at her desk job.

She denies any numbness or tingling in her limbs. There is no history of recent trauma or heavy lifting. She does not report any difficulty with vision, speech, swallowing, or breathing. She has not experienced any bowel or bladder dysfunction. She recalls feeling generally well until the onset of these symptoms.

Upon further questioning, she mentions that about two weeks ago, she had a brief episode of diarrhea for a couple of days after returning from a camping trip but did not seek medical attention as it resolved on its own.
