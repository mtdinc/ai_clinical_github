A 52-year-old male is brought to the ED by EMS after being found slumped over at a downtown bus stop at 8 PM. Bystanders report he was mumbling and attempted to walk but kept falling. Initial EMS assessment notes a laceration on his forehead. The patient is intermittently cooperative, giving confused answers about his location and repeatedly stating he "just needs to sleep it off." He mentions having lost his job today but becomes agitated when questioned further. He denies IV substance use but can't reliably state when he last ate.
