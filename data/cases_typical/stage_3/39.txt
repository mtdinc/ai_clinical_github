**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 58-year-old female hairdresser presents to the ED with sudden onset of "room spinning" that began 3 hours ago while washing a client's hair at work. She describes the sensation as severe rotational dizziness, feeling like she's "on a carousel that won't stop." The episode started suddenly with no warning, causing her to grab onto the sink for support. She reports intense nausea and has vomited twice since onset. Symptoms worsen with any head movement and improve slightly when perfectly still. She denies hearing loss, tinnitus, or headache, but mentions feeling unsteady for about 10 seconds one morning last week while getting out of bed, which resolved spontaneously.
