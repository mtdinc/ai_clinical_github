**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 72-year-old retired plumber presents to his primary care physician with persistent lower back discomfort that has gradually worsened over the past few weeks. He describes the pain as a deep, dull ache in his lower back and abdomen, sometimes radiating to his left groin. He initially attributed the discomfort to age-related aches and the increased physical activity of gardening and lifting heavy bags of soil. Over-the-counter pain medications like naproxen have provided minimal relief.

He denies any recent trauma or falls. He reports no changes in his bowel or bladder habits, no abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, fever, or weight loss. His appetite is normal, but he feels more fatigued than usual, which he attributes to poor sleep due to the discomfort. He has not noticed any chest pain or shortness of breath.
