**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 47-year-old male construction worker presents to his primary care clinic with a persistent cough that has been ongoing for the past six weeks. Initially, the cough was dry, but over the past two weeks, it has become productive of foul-smelling sputum, occasionally streaked with blood. He also reports increasing fatigue, night sweats, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 pounds during this period. He attributes the weight loss to decreased appetite and long working hours.

He denies experiencing fever, chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or recent upper respiratory tract infections. Over-the-counter cough medications have provided minimal relief. He has not sought medical attention until now because he thought the symptoms would resolve on their own.
