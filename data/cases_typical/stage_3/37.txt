**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 67-year-old male presents to the emergency department due to feeling lightheaded while working in his garden this morning. He noticed his stools have been dark and "sticky" for the past 3 days but attributed this to starting iron supplements last week for fatigue. Today he felt dizzy upon standing and noticed his heart racing. He denies frank blood in stool, abdominal pain, or vomiting, though mentions occasional acid reflux that's been worse lately. He's been taking extra ibuprofen for chronic knee pain, usually "two or three at a time," several times daily.
