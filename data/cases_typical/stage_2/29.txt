**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 35-year-old female presents to urgent care reporting an unusual headache pattern over the past 24 hours. Yesterday morning, while editing photos, she experienced subtle zigzag lines and shimmering spots in her peripheral vision, followed by difficulty reading text messages. These visual disturbances lasted about 30 minutes before resolving. Subsequently, she developed a dull ache behind her right eye that has progressively intensified to a severe throbbing pain. She's had tension headaches before but emphasizes this feels distinctly different. The pain is now accompanied by nausea, sensitivity to light and sound, and is significantly worsened by movement. She tried her usual ibuprofen without relief and noticed she felt unusually irritable the day before symptoms began. Of note, she's been working longer hours with increased screen time due to peak wedding season.
