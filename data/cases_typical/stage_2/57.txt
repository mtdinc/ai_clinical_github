**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 36-year-old male elementary school teacher presents to his primary care clinic with intermittent lower abdominal discomfort over the past week. He describes the pain as a dull ache located just above the pubic bone, occasionally radiating to his perineum and lower back. The discomfort is mild to moderate (4/10) and seems to worsen at the end of the day. He also notes increased fatigue and has attributed these symptoms to stress and prolonged sitting during virtual classes.

He reports mild urinary symptoms over the past few days, including a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying and occasionally having to strain to initiate urination. He denies any burning during urination, frequency, urgency, or visible blood in the urine. He mentions waking up once or twice at night to urinate, which he thought was due to increased water intake. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or sexual dysfunction.

His medical history is unremarkable, and he has not had any recent illnesses. His last sexual activity was two weeks ago with his monogamous partner. He denies any new sexual partners and reports inconsistent condom use.
