**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 35-year-old elementary school teacher presents to the emergency department with 3 days of what she thought was a "terrible sinus headache." She initially took Sudafed and Tylenol with minimal relief. Her 5-year-old son had a "stomach bug" last week with fever and diarrhea. She denies the classic severe headache or neck stiffness but notes feeling "foggy" and more sensitive to the classroom lights. She's been wearing sunglasses indoors and had to leave work early today because she felt nauseated while grading papers.
