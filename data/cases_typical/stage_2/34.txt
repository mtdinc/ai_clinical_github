**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 58-year-old restaurant owner presents to the ED with severe right toe pain that woke him from sleep at 3 AM. He initially attributed the pain to possibly dropping a heavy pot on his foot during the busy dinner service, but can't specifically recall an injury. The pain has rapidly intensified over 6 hours, describing it as "feeling like my toe is being crushed." He reports the toe is now so sensitive that even the weight of a bed sheet is excruciating. Of note, he mentions hosting a wine tasting event at his restaurant over the weekend where he sampled several red wines and enjoyed a variety of seafood dishes. He's been under increased stress preparing for restaurant inspection and has been eating irregularly.
