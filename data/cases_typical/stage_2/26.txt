**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 52-year-old delivery truck driver presents to urgent care complaining of feeling "off" for the past day.  Reports unusual fatigue during his morning deliveries and general body discomfort that he initially attributed to sleeping poorly in his truck during long routes. Mentions his joints feel "heavy." Upon further questioning, he describes severe body aches throughout his body and a nonproductive cough that recently developed. His fatigue has become profound, making it difficult to complete his usual delivery routes, and he has lost interest in eating. Family members who accompanied him mention he's been showing signs of new onset confusion, which prompted them to convince him to seek medical attention.
