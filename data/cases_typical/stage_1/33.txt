**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 45-year-old accountant presents to her primary care physician at her sister's insistence. Over the past 2-3 months, she has experienced progressive difficulty getting out of bed, decreased interest in her usual activities, and significant weight loss. She acknowledges missing several deadlines at work, something previously uncharacteristic for her. Her sister became particularly concerned after noticing unwashed dishes piling up and multiple missed family gatherings. The patient initially attributed these changes to "work stress" following a recent promotion but admits she spends most weekends in bed "trying to gather energy for Monday." When questioned about mood, she states, "I just feel empty" and notes difficulty concentrating during meetings. She denies any specific traumatic events.
