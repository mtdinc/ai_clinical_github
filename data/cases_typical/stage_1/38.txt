**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 58-year-old male supervisor at a construction site presents to the ED with episodes of chest "pressure" occurring with progressively less exertion over the past week. Initially, he only noticed discomfort while climbing stairs at work sites, but now experiences symptoms while walking short distances. Today, he felt the pressure while getting dressed. The sensation is described as a heavy weight in the center of his chest, radiating to his left shoulder, lasting 5-10 minutes and improving with rest. He's been using his nitroglycerin spray more frequently than usual. Of particular concern, his most recent episode occurred at rest while watching TV, prompting this visit.
