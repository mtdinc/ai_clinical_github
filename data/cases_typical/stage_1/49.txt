**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 68-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with 3 days of "pulled muscle pain" in his left upper back. He recently helped his son move furniture and attributes the discomfort to overexertion. He describes the pain as "burning and deep," worse when putting on his shirt. This morning he noticed his skin feels unusually sensitive in that area, making his shower uncomfortable. He's been taking ibuprofen without relief and notes poor sleep due to discomfort.
