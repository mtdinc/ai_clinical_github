**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 64-year-old male with diabetes is brought to the emergency department by his daughter who found him "not being himself" during their weekly dinner. She reports he was picking at his food, which is unusual, and seemed confused about what day it was. She noticed he was wearing the same clothes as yesterday and his house was unusually messy.
