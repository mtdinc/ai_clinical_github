A 62-year-old male presents to the ED with progressive abdominal discomfort and bloating that started yesterday evening. He reports having several episodes of vomiting overnight, initially food contents but now becoming darker and foul-smelling. He hasn't had a bowel movement in 3 days despite usually being regular.
