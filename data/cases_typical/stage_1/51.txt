**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 58-year-old project manager presents to the ED at 3 AM with sudden onset of "something wrong in my back." Pain began during sleep, causing him to pace around his bedroom. He's had chronic back pain from working long hours at his desk but states this feels different and moving doesn't help. He took his usual cyclobenzaprine without relief.
