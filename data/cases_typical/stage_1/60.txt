**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 63-year-old female presents to the primary care clinic with complaints of increasing fatigue and generalized weakness over the past month. She reports difficulty performing her usual activities, such as gardening and walking her dog, due to feeling "drained" and unsteady on her feet. She has also noticed mild headaches and occasional episodes of feeling lightheaded. She attributes these symptoms to aging and recent stress related to family matters.

She mentions intermittent abdominal discomfort, describing it as a vague, dull ache in the epigastric region. This discomfort is not related to meals and does not radiate. She denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. She reports a decreased appetite and has unintentionally lost about 5 pounds over the past two months. She also notes increased urination during the daytime, which she attributes to drinking more herbal teas.

Her sleep has been disturbed by frequent awakenings, and she feels unrested in the mornings. She denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, cough, fever, night sweats, or recent infections. She has not traveled recently and has not had any sick contacts.
