**Stage 1: Initial Presentation**

A 45-year-old middle school teacher presents to urgent care with worsening facial pressure and thick nasal discharge for the past 10 days. Symptoms began as what she thought was a typical cold with clear runny nose and mild congestion. However, over the past three days, she's developed increasing pressure over her cheeks and forehead, worse when bending forward to tie her shoes. Her nasal discharge has become yellowish-green, and she notes a persistent post-nasal drip with an unpleasant taste in her mouth. She reports poor sleep due to throat irritation and mouth breathing. This morning, she noticed mild toothache in her upper teeth, which prompted her visit.
